# Real-time AQI Anomaly Detection System for Lahore: Data Engineering to ML Ops End-to-End Project

This comprehensive project showcases a robust, **end-to-end machine learning system** focused on **real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) anomaly detection specifically for Lahore, Pakistan.** It demonstrates a full MLOps lifecycle, from high-performance data ingestion and machine learning model development to real-time API deployment, automated retraining, continuous monitoring, and an interactive dashboard, leveraging a robust skill set in Python, Go, data science, and the Django web framework.

## Project Aim & Core Functionality

The primary goal is to create a scalable and reliable Real-time AQI Anomaly Detection System that:

* **Real-time Data Ingestion:** Establishes efficient data pipelines using **Go (GoLang)** for high-performance, concurrent data ingestion primarily from the **"OpenWeather website" API**. This Go service cleans, transforms, and reliably stores incoming raw AQI data (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, Ozone, etc.) in a **MongoDB Atlas (Free Tier)** database for historical record and further processing.

* **Predictive Anomaly Detection (Prophet ML):** Applies data science techniques in **Python** to develop, train, and evaluate a predictive model using the **Prophet algorithm**. This model is capable of identifying anomalies in the processed AQI data through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and rigorous evaluation, effectively distinguishing abnormal AQI patterns from normal fluctuations.

* **Real-time Model Serving API:** Deploys the trained Python ML model as a high-performance web service using **FastAPI** for the model serving layer. This API allows other applications or internal services to send real-time AQI data points and receive immediate anomaly predictions (including predicted normal range, deviation, and anomaly status).

* **MLOps for Automated Management:** Implements MLOps practices for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) of both the Go ingestion service and the Python ML model. This includes model versioning, continuous performance monitoring (e.g., detecting concept drift or data drift in AQI patterns), and setting up **automated re-training triggers** based on performance degradation or shifts in environmental factors. Flagged anomalous AQI data is also stored in **MongoDB Atlas** for review and further analysis by environmental authorities or stakeholders.

* **Comprehensive User Interface with Dashboard & Alert System:** Develops a web application using **Django** to interact with the deployed system. This interface features:
    * A dynamic dashboard for visualizing incoming real-time AQI data streams, real-time detected anomalies across different pollutants, and key performance indicators of the system.
    * A robust alert system to notify relevant stakeholders (e.g., environmental agencies, health departments, citizens) immediately when AQI anomalies are detected, potentially via email, SMS, or in-app notifications.
    * Functionality to review historical anomaly flags from the **MongoDB Atlas** database, analyze past AQI trends, and potentially manage model configurations or view detailed performance reports.

## Technical Stack & Skills Utilized

* **Data Science (Python):** Core for EDA of AQI data, feature engineering (e.g., temporal features, lagged values), model selection, training, and evaluation for time-series anomaly detection using **Prophet** and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
* **Data Ingestion:** **Go (GoLang)** for building high-performance, concurrent data ingestion services to reliably pull and process real-time data from the OpenWeather website API.
* **Backend API:** **FastAPI** (Python web framework) for exposing the trained ML model as a real-time anomaly prediction service.
* **Frontend & Dashboard:** **Django** (Python Web Framework) for building the interactive web application, dashboard, and alert system components.
* **Database:** **MongoDB Atlas (Free Tier)** for storing raw ingested AQI data, flagged anomalous AQI data, and potentially model metadata.
* **Data Engineering:** Designing and implementing robust data pipelines for real-time AQI ingestion, ETL processes, managing efficient data storage in MongoDB, and ensuring data quality and availability.
* **MLOps:** Implementing CI/CD for ML models and services, continuous model monitoring (especially for detecting concept drift in AQI patterns), model versioning, experiment tracking, and infrastructure management for the end-to-end ML system.
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub.

## Level of Complexity: Advanced

This project is designed to be of advanced complexity, showcasing proficiency in building robust, end-to-end machine learning systems:

* **Real-time Processing Requirements:** Implementing a truly real-time data ingestion pipeline from an external API (like OpenWeather) and immediate anomaly detection using Go introduces significant challenges related to low-latency processing, robust stream handling, and error management.
* **Polyglot & Microservices Integration:** Seamlessly integrates diverse technologies across different ecosystems: Go (for performance-critical services), Python (for complex ML models and web UI), and MongoDB (for scalable data persistence), requiring careful architecture design and expertise across multiple platforms.
* **Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Prophet:** Anomaly detection in time-series data (like AQI) using Prophet is inherently complex, requiring specialized algorithms to account for seasonality, trends, and periodicity, demanding careful feature engineering and robust evaluation in a dynamic, real-time environment.
* **End-to-End MLOps for Real-time:** Implementing CI/CD, **automated re-training triggers**, continuous model monitoring (e.g., detecting sudden shifts or drifts in AQI patterns), and model versioning for a real-time system adds substantial operational complexity compared to batch-oriented systems.
* **Scalability and Resilience:** The system needs to be designed for high availability and scalability to handle continuous AQI data streams and provide immediate predictions, requiring considerations for distributed systems, message queues, and fault tolerance.
* **Specific Geographic Focus & UI Features:** Focusing on a specific geographic area (Lahore) and its unique environmental context adds a layer of data interpretation complexity. The explicit inclusion of a real-time dashboard and a robust alert system further increases the front-end and integration complexity, vital for effective public health and environmental management.

This project provides an intensive and comprehensive learning experience, solidifying your understanding of how complex machine learning systems, particularly real-time anomaly detection in an environmental context, are built, deployed, and maintained in a production environment.
